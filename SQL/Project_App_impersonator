Project: App impersonator



Think about your favorite apps, and pick one that stores your data- like a game that stores scores, an app that lets you post updates, etc. Now in this project, you're going to imagine that the app stores your data in a SQL database (which is pretty likely!), and write SQL statements that might look like their own SQL.
CREATE a table to store the data.
INSERT a few example rows in the table.
Use an UPDATE to emulate what happens when you edit data in the app.
Use a DELETE to emulate what happens when you delete data in the app.


Ans;--
/* What does the app's SQL look like? */

CREATE TABLE app_data(
id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
name TEXT,
review INTEGER,
location TEXT,
usetime INTEGER
);

SELECT * from app_data;

/* Adding values into the database */

INSERT INTO app_data VALUES(1,'david',5,'London',520);

INSERT INTO app_data VALUES(2,'hawking',3,'British Columbia',600);
INSERT INTO app_data VALUES(3,'stephen',2,'Paris',780);
INSERT INTO app_data VALUES(4,'Harry',5,'Boston',500);
INSERT INTO app_data VALUES(5,'Harison',4,'India',560);
INSERT INTO app_data VALUES(6,'davidson',5,'London',520);


SELECT * FROM app_data;
SELECT * FROM app_data GROUP BY location;


/* Update the values from david to Wisley*/
UPDATE  app_data SET name='Wisley' WHERE name='david';
SELECT * FROM app_data;

/* Delete the row contain name= 'davidson' */ 
DELETE FROM app_data WHERE name='davidson';
SELECT * FROM app_data;

/* Add extra column as 'regular user' */
ALTER TABLE app_data ADD regular_user TEXT default 'unknown';
SELECT * FROM app_data;
INSERT INTO app_data VALUES(6, 'Rahols', 4,'India',730, 'yes');
SELECT * from app_data

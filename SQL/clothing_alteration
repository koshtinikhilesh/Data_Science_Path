Challenge: Clothing alterations
Step1
We've created a database of clothes, and decided we need a price column. Use ALTER to add a 'price' column to the table. Then select all the columns in each row to see what your table looks like now.

CREATE TABLE clothes (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    type TEXT,
    design TEXT);
    
INSERT INTO clothes (type, design)
    VALUES ("dress", "pink polka dots");
INSERT INTO clothes (type, design)
    VALUES ("pants", "rainbow tie-dye");
INSERT INTO clothes (type, design)
    VALUES ("blazer", "black sequin");
ALTER TABLE clothes ADD price INTEGER;
SELECT * FROM clothes

Now assign each item a price, using UPDATE - item 1 should be 10 dollars, item 2 should be 20 dollars, item 3 should be 30 dollars. When you're done, do another SELECT of all the rows to check that it worked as expected.

CREATE TABLE clothes (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    type TEXT,
    design TEXT);
    
INSERT INTO clothes (type, design)
    VALUES ("dress", "pink polka dots");
INSERT INTO clothes (type, design)
    VALUES ("pants", "rainbow tie-dye");
INSERT INTO clothes (type, design)
    VALUES ("blazer", "black sequin");
ALTER TABLE clothes ADD price INTEGER;
SELECT * FROM clothes;
UPDATE clothes SET price=10 WHERE id = 1;

UPDATE clothes SET price=20 WHERE id = 2;
UPDATE clothes SET price=30 WHERE id = 3;



SELECT * FROM clothes;


Now insert a new item into the table that has all three attributes filled in, including 'price'. Do one final SELECT of all the rows to check it worked.

CREATE TABLE clothes (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    type TEXT,
    design TEXT);
    
INSERT INTO clothes (type, design)
    VALUES ("dress", "pink polka dots");
INSERT INTO clothes (type, design)
    VALUES ("pants", "rainbow tie-dye");
INSERT INTO clothes (type, design)
    VALUES ("blazer", "black sequin");
ALTER TABLE clothes ADD price INTEGER;
SELECT * FROM clothes;
UPDATE clothes SET price=10 WHERE id = 1;

UPDATE clothes SET price=20 WHERE id = 2;
UPDATE clothes SET price=30 WHERE id = 3;


SELECT * FROM clothes;
INSERT INTO clothes VALUES(4,'trouser','white colored', 40);
SELECT * from clothes

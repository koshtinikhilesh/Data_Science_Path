Challenge: The wordiest author
We've created a database of a few popular authors and their books, with word counts for each book. In this first step, select all the authors who have written more than 1 million words, using GROUP BY and HAVING. Your results table should include the 'author' and their total word count as a 'total_words' column.

Now select all the authors that write more than an average of 150,000 words per book. Your results table should include the 'author' and average words as an 'avg_words' column.

CREATE TABLE books (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    author TEXT,
    title TEXT,
    words INTEGER);
